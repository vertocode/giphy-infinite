# Introduction

Giphy Infinite is a web application that allows you to search for gifs using the Giphy API. It has a clean and simple interface, and it is also responsive. The app has infinite scroll, so you can keep scrolling and the app will keep loading more gifs. You can also click on a gif to see it in full size, and you can download the gif's to share it with your friends.

It was created as a challenge project for [SGBR](https://sgbr.com.br/) in a interview process.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone git@github.com:vertocode/giphy-infinite.git
```

2. Install the dependencies (I'm using [bun](https://bun.sh/), but you can use other like npm or yarn)
```sh
cd giphy-infinite
bun i
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the Giphy API key
```sh
VUE_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

4. Run the app
```sh
bun dev
```

Now it should be able to access the app at `http://localhost:9000`. (If this port is already in use, will be used the next available port)
